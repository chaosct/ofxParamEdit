ofxParamEdit
by nariakiiwatani

Abstract:
ofxParamEdit provides the SIMPLEST interface to edit values with GUI.
You don't have to keep ofxBaseGui instances in your code.
Only you have to do is passing normal variables (like int, float,,,) to ofxParamEdit (and keeping them alive).

Depend to...:
ofxGui

Usage:
see example/src/testApp.cpp

For ofxGui users:
convert your code like below...
<<<<<<< .from
ofxFloatSlider f;
f.setup("float value", 0, -1, 1);
f.draw();
=======
float f = 0;
ofxParamEdit edit;
edit.addFloat("float value", f, -1, 1);
edit.draw();
>>>>>>> .to
even after the change, doSomething(f) will remain the same. :)


Tips:
How to show two or more panels at the same time:
-Create two or more ofxParamEdit instances.

How to edit a variable with multiple panel:
-Add the variable twice simply.
-(Because of ofxGui's spec, opposite view will not be updated.)
